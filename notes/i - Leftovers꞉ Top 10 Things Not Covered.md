# i - Leftovers: *Top 10 Things Not Covered*

## 1) Everything else in Statistics
- sampling
- probability
- test of significance
- chance variability
- ... ...

## 2) Excel skills
[Head First Excel](@tag/Notebooks/HF Excel)

## 3) Data/Information Visualization
**Edward Tufte & his Principles of Visualization** :+1:
- Show **comparisons, constraints, differences**.
- Show **causality, mechanism, explanations, systematic structure**.
- Show **multivariate data** (i.e., >= 2 variables).
- Completely **integrate** words, numbers, images, and diagrams.
- Thoroughly describe the **evidence**.
- Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the **content, quality, relevance, and integrity** of data. 

## 4) Pivot Tables
- fantastic for **exploratory data analysis**
- fantastic for **summarizing data extracted from relational databases**

## 5) The R Community

## 6) Non-Linear & Multiple Regression
- for **data without a linear pattern**, sometimes you can
  - apply numerial transformation to make the data linear
  - *or* draw a polynominal regression line through the dots
- to **predict a variable affected by multiple independent variables**:
  - you can use multiple regression
  - y = a + bX~1~ + cX~2~ + dX~3~ + ...

## 7) Null-Alternative Hypothesis Testing
> given my data, what is the viability of the null hypothesis?

## 8) Randomness
- randomness is a big issue in data analysis
- randomness is **hard to see**
- randomness means that **explanatory models sometimes just don't work**
- a specific event happened just "can be explained by **random variations in outcomes**"

## 9) Google Docs

## 10) Your Domain Expertise
