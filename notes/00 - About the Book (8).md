# 00 - About the Book
Title: Storytelling with Data
Author: Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic
Year: 2015 (1st Edition)
ISBN: 978-1-119-00226-0 (ePDF)

*There is a story in your data. But **your tools don’t know what that story is**. That’s where it takes you, the analyst or communicator of the information, to bring that story visually and contextually to life.*

*That process is the focus of this book. The lessons we will cover will enable you to shift from simply **showing data** to **storytelling with data**.*

*Also, take the time to learn your tool well so that it does not become a limiting factor when it comes to applying the lessons we’ll cover throughout this book.*
