# 05 - Think Like a Designer

> **Form follows function.** When it comes to the form and function of our data visualizations, we first want to think about what it is we want our audience to be able to do with the data (function) and create a visualization (form) that will allow for this with ease. Designers know the fundamentals of good design but also how to trust their eye. This chapter will instill confidence in your visual instincts and provide some concrete tips to follow and adjustments to make when things don’t feel quite right. `rules + instincts` :smile:

> By understanding and employing some traditional design concepts, we set ourselves up for success in communicating with data. Offer your audience visual affordances as cues for how to interact with your communication: highlight the important stuff, eliminate distractions, and create a visual hierarchy of information. Make your designs accessible by not overcomplicating and by leveraging text to label and explain. Increase your audience’s tolerance of design issues by making your visuals aesthetically pleasing. Employ the strategies discussed for gaining audience acceptance for your visual designs.

## Affordances

These are aspects **inherent** to the design that make it obvious how the product is to be used. These characteristics suggest how the object is to be interacted with or operated. When **sufficient affordances** are present, **good design fades into the background** and you don’t even notice it.

Translate the concept of affordances to communicating with data: We can leverage visual affordances to indicate to our audience how to use and interact with our visualiza tions. Three lessons on *highlight*, *distraction*, and *visual hierarchy* :point_down: By highlighting the important stuff, eliminating distractions, and establishing a visual hierarchy, the data visualizations we create ***afford* understanding**.

### Highlight the Important Stuff

Only highlight a fraction (**at most 10%**) of the overall visual, since highlighting effects are diluted as the percentage that are highlighted increases.

- **Bold**ing is generally preferred over italics and underlining because it adds minimal noise to the design while clearly highlighting chosen elements. **Italics** add minimal noise, but also don’t stand out as much and are less legible. **Underlining** adds noise and compromises legibility, so should be used sparingly (if at all).
- **Uppercase** in short word sequences. Avoid using different **fonts** (typefaces) to highlight.
- **Color**, sparingly and in concert with other highlighting techniques.
- **Inversing** elements is effective at attracting attention, but can add considerable noise to a design so should be used sparingly.
- **Size** signals importance.

Preattentive attributes can be **layered**, so if you have something really important, you can signal this and draw attention by making it large, colored, and bold.

### Eliminate Distractions

> “You know you’ve achieved perfection, not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing to take away” (Saint‐Exupery, 1943).

Clutter is elements that take up space but don't add information to our visuals. Context is what needs to be present for your audience in order to make sense of your communication. **No clutter; only the right amoung of context.** Each step in reduction and de-emphasis causes what remains to stand out more.

- Not all data are equally important.
- When detail isn’t needed, summarize.
- Ask yourself: would eliminating this change anything? No? Take it out!
- Push necessary, but non-message-impacting items to the background.

### Create a Clear Visual Hierarchy of Information

We can visually pull some items to the forefront and push other elements to the background, indicating to our audience the general order in which they should process the information we are communicating.

> :bulb: **Super-Categories**: In tables and graphs, it can sometimes be useful to leverage super-categories to organize the data and help provide a construct for your audience to use to interpret it. These super-categories provide a hierarchical organization that simplifies the process of taking in the information. `e.g., quadrant labels, subtotals` :open_mouth:

## Accessibility

Designs should be usable by people of diverse abilities.
Good design takes into account the needs of the user.

Two specific strategies :point_down: for data communication accessibility:

### Don't Over-Complicate

The more complicated it looks, the more time your audience perceives it will take to understand and the less likely they are to spend time to understand it.

- **Legible**: consistent, easy-to-read font (typeface & size)
- **Clean**: make viz approachable by leveraging visual affordances
- **Straightforward Languuage**: simple, fewer, define terms, spell out acronyms
- **Remove Unnecessary Complexity**: choose simple over complicated

:x: over-simplifying / over-complicating
:+1: not making thing more complicated than necessary

### Text is Your Friend

Text plays a number of roles in communicating with data: use it to label, introduce, explain, reinforce, highlight, recommend, and tell a story.

- **Titles**: don't let the audience guess what they are looking at.
- **Conclusion**: state important conclusions in words; don't assume people reach the same conclusion from the same data visualization; sometimes even include the conclusion in "action titles" that set expectations.
- **Annotation**: for important/interesting points.

## Aesthetics

People **perceive** more aesthetic designs **as easier to use** than less aesthetic designs, whether they actually are or not. Pretty designs are also more readily **accepted** and used over time, promote creative thinking and problem solving, and foster **positive** relationships, making people more **tolerant** of problems with designs. The attention to aesthetics shows a general **respect** for your work and your audience.

- **Color**: use colors sparingly, intentionally, strategically
- **Alignment**: create clean vertical and horizontal lines for unity and cohesion
- **White Space**: preserve margins; don't oversize graphics to fill the space

## Acceptance

It is a fact of human nature that most people experience some level of discomfort with change. Making significant changes to “the way we’ve always done it” may require more work to gain acceptance than simply replacing the old with the new.

- Articulate the **benefits of the new**/different approach:
  *Sometimes simply giving people transparency into why things will look different going forward can help them feel more comfortable.*
- Show the **side-by-side**:
  *If the new approach is clearly superior to the old, showing them side-by-side will demonstrate this.*
- Provide **multiple options**, and seek input:
  *Rather than prescribing the design, consider creating several options and getting feedback from colleagues, audience (if appropriate), and a non-biased third party.*
- Get a vocal member of your **audience on board**
  *Identify influential members of your audience and talk to them one-on-one in an effort to gain acceptance of your design. Ask for their feedback and incorporate it.*
