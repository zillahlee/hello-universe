# 10 - Final Thoughts

> Data visualization—and communicating with data in general—sits at the intersection of science and art. There is certainly some science to it: best practices and guidelines to follow. There is also an artistic component. Apply the lessons we’ve covered to forge your path, using your artistic license to make the information easier for your audience to understand. In this final chapter, we discuss tips on where to go from here and strategies for upskilling storytelling with data competency in your team and your organization. We end with a recap of the main lessons covered.

## Where To Go From Here

The simple way to get good at this is to do it: **practice, practice, and practice some more**. Look for opportunities in your work to apply the lessons we’ve learned. Note that it doesn’t have to be all or nothing—one way to make progress is through **incremental improvements** to existing or ongoing work. Consider also when you can leverage the entire storytelling with data process that we’ve covered from start to finish.

### *Tip #1:* Learn Your Tools Well

Try not to let your tools be a limiting factor when it comes to communicating effectively with data. Pick one and get to know it as best you can. The best way to learn a tool is to use it.

**MS Excel**, **Tableau** (Story Points for explanatory), Google Spreadsheets, **Python**, R, JavaScript D3, Adobe Illustrator... & **Paper** :smile:

***PowerPoint** is simply the mechanism to organize a handout or present on the big screen. Always start from a totally blank slide and do not leverage the built-in bullets that too easily turn content from presentation to teleprompter. When using **animation** in PowerPoint, use only simple Appear or Disappear (in some instances, Transparency can also be useful); steer clear of any animation that causes elements to fly in or fade out—this is the presentation software equivalent of 3D graphs—unnecessary and distracting!*

### *Tip #2:* Iterate & Seek Feedback

I’ve presented the storytelling with data process as a linear path. That’s not often the case in reality. Rather, it takes iterating to get from early ideas to a final solution. When the best course for visualizing certain data is unclear, **start with a blank piece of paper**. This enables you to brainstorm without the constraints of your tools or what you know how to do in your tools. Sketch out potential views to see them side-by-side and determine what will work best for getting your message across to your audience. I find that we form less attachment to our work product—which can make iterating easier—when we are working on paper rather than on our computers.

:bulb: Always make a copy of the original and do **A/B testing**! Often, the practice of seeing slight variations next to each other makes it quickly clear which view is superior. Progress in this manner, preserving the latest “best” visual and continuing to make minor modifications in a copy (so you always have the prior version to go back to in case the modificatio worsens it) to iterate toward your ideal visual.

At any point, if the best path is unclear, seek feedback. The fresh set of eyes that a friend or colleague can bring to the data visualization endeavor is invaluable. Show someone else your visual and have them talk you through their thought process.

### *Tip #3:* Devote Time to Data Storytelling

Everything we’ve discussed throughout this book takes time.
It takes even more time to do all of this well.

One of my biggest tips for success in storytelling with data is to **allow adequate time** for it. If we don’t consciously recognize that this takes time to do well and budget accordingly, our time can be entirely eaten up by the other parts of the analytical process.

The default settings of our graphing application are typically far from ideal. Our tools do not know the story we aim to tell. Combine these two things and you run the risk of losing a great deal of potential value (including the opportunity to drive action and effect change) if adequate time isn’t spent on this final step in the analytical process: **the communication step, the only part of the entire process that your audience actually *sees*.**

### *Tip #4:* Seek Inspiration through Good Examples

**Imitation** really is the best form of flattery. If you see a data visualization or example of storytelling with data that you like, consider how you might **adapt** the approach for your own use. Pause to reflect on what makes it effective. Make a copy of it and create a visual library that you can add to over time and refer to for inspiration. **Emulate** the good examples and approaches that you see.

You can learn as much from the **poor examples** of data visualization (what not to do) as you can from those that are effective. Don't only recognize when you encounter a poor example of data visualization; pause and reflect on why it isn’t ideal and how it could be improved.

### *Tip #5:* Have Fun & Find Your Style

When most people think about data, one of the furthest things from their mind is creativity. But within data visualization, there is absolutely space for creativity to play a role. Data can be made to be breathtakingly beautiful. Don’t be afraid to try new approaches and play a little. You’ll continue to learn what works and what doesn’t over time.

To the extent that it makes sense given the task at hand, don’t be afraid to let your own style develop and creativity come through when you communicate with data. Company brand can also play a role in developing a data visualization style; consider your company’s brand and whether there are opportunities to fold that into how you visualize and communicate with data. Just make sure that your approach and stylistic elements are making the information easier—not more difficult—for your audience to consume.

## Recap

We have learned a great deal over the course of this book, from
context to cutting clutter and drawing attention to telling a robust
story. We’ve worn our designer hats and looked at things through our
audience’s eyes. Here is a review of the main lessons we’ve covered:

1. **Understand the context.**
  Build a clear understanding of who you are communicating to, what you need them to know or do, how you will communicate to them, and what data you have to back up your case. Employ concepts like the 3-minute story, the Big Idea, and storyboarding to articulate your story and plan the desired content and flow
2. **Choose an appropriate visual display.**
  When highlighting a number or two, simple text is best. Line charts are usually best for continuous data. Bar charts work great for categorical data and must have a zero baseline. Let the relationship you want to show guide the type of chart you choose. Avoid pies, donuts, 3D, and secondary y-axes due to difficulty of visual interpretation.
3. **Eliminate clutter.**
  Identify elements that don’t add informative value and remove them from your visuals. Leverage the Gestalt principles to understand how people see and identify candidates for elimination. Use contrast strategically. Employ alignment of elements and maintain white space to help make the interpretation of your visuals a comfortable experience for your audience.
4. **Focus attention where you want it.**
  Employ the power of preattentive attributes like color, size, and position to signal what’s important. Use these strategic attributes to draw attention to where you want your audience to look and guide your audience through your visual. Evaluate the effectiveness of preattentive attributes in your visual by applying the “where are your eyes drawn?” test.
5. **Think like a designer.**
  Offer your audience visual affordances as cues for how to interact with your communication: highlight the important stuff, eliminate distractions, and create a visual hierarchy of information. Make your designs accessible by not overcomplicating and leveraging text to label and explain. Increase your audience’s tolerance of design issues by making your visuals aesthetically pleasing. Work to gain audience acceptance of your visual designs.
6. **Tell a story.**
  Craft a story with clear beginning (plot), middle (twists), and end (call to action). Leverage conflict and tension to grab and maintain your audience’s attention. Consider the order and manner of your narrative. Utilize the power of repetition to help your stories stick. Employ tactics like vertical and horizontal logic, reverse storyboarding, and seeking a fresh perspective to ensure that your story comes across clearly in your communication.

> There is a story in your data. If you weren’t convinced of that before our journey together, I hope you are now. Use the lessons we’ve covered to make that story clear to your audience. Help drive better decision making and motivate your audience to act. Never again will you simply show data. Rather, you will create visualizations that are thoughtfully designed to impart information and incite action. **Go forth and tell your stories with data!**
