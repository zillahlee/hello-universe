# 01 - Stats Big Picture

## Descciption Statistics
**research subject**: data (lots of)

- **Data Collection**
  - Population (census)
  - Sampling (random, stratified, etc.)
- **Data Interpretation**
  - Distribution
    - Central Tendency: mean, median, mode
    - Dispersion Degree: min/max, variation, s.d., quantiles
  - Correlation
    - covariance, correlation coefficient, R-square?

-----
## Inferential Statistics
**research subject**: events (one at a time)
*generalization of findings from a sample*
*theoretically, based on probability (math branch)*

- **Hypothesis Testing**
  - Mindset: null-hypothesis testing?
  - Methods: z-test, t-test, f-test, etc.
- **Parameter Estimation**
  - Point Estimation
  - Interval/Range Estimation

## Planning a Statistical Study
1. state a hypothesis
2. identify the individuals of interest
3. specify the variables to measure
4. determine whether to use entire population or a sample
  4.1. if sample, choose a sampling method
5. address ethical concerns
6. collect the data
7. use descriptive/inferential statistics to answer/evaluate the hypothesis
8. note any concerns about data collection or analysis; make recommendations for future studies
