> Through the examples in this chapter, we’ve reinforced a number of the lessons covered up to this point. There is something to be learned from every example of data visualization you encounter—both good and bad. In data visualization, there is rarely (if ever) a single “right” answer; rather, there are flavors of good. Again, make sure your design choices are **intentional**.
