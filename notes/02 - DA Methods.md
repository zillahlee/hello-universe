| Method    | When to use? | Why effective? | How to use? |
| :-------- | :----------- | :------------- | :-----------|
| Regression  | explain; predict | emmm | range error, chance error |

## Observation vs. Experiment
- **Observation**
  - When to use?
  - Why effective?
  - How to use?

- **Experiment**
  - When to use?
    - grab new data
  - Why effective?
    - controlled testing
  - How to use?

## Optimization vs. Heuristics
- **Optimization**
  - When to use?
    - the objective: try to max/min one variable
    - have all key numerical data (variables)
  - Why effective?
  - How to use?

- **Heuristics**
  - When to use?
    - too many variables
    - not enough data/time
  - Why effective?
  - How to use?
    - pick key variables
    - reasoning with experience + data

## Hypothesis Testing vs. Bayes' Rule
- **Hypothesis Testing**
  - When to use?
    - no prior knowledge
    - have several hypothesis
    - have several evidences
  - Why effective?
  - How to use?
    - use evidences to rank hypothesis

- **Bayes' Rule**
  - When to use?
    - have prior knowledge
    - have new evidence
  - Why effective?
    - prevent overcompensating
  - How to use?
    - calculate how new evidence changes prior hypothesis

## Others
- **Regression**
  - When to use?
    - explain association
    - predict dependent variable based on independent variable(s)
  - Why effective?
  - How to use?
    - range error
    - chance error

- **Subjective Probability**
  - When to use?
    - predict single event(s)
    - have expert beliefs
    - no hard data from prior experiences
  - Why effective?
    - much more unambiguous
  - How to use?

- **Standard Deviation**
  - When to use?
    - measure spread
    - measure the disagreement among subjective beliefs
  - Why effective?
  - How to use?
