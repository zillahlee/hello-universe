# 09 - Charts: *Graph your data*

> 

## Chart Creation & Configuration

#### Create Charts using the <mark>Insert</mark> Tab
- Select Data

#### Rework Charts using the <mark>Design</mark> Tab
- Chart Elements Layout
  - title
  - labels
  - legend
- Move Chart (e.g., to a new sheet)

## Types of Charts
- **Histogram** 
- **Scatterplot** plots two variables with the option of fitting a curve to the data points.
  - **Bubble** adds a third dimension of area to a scatterplot.
- **Line Graph** shows changing trends, generally over time.
- **Bar Chart** performs basic comparison, using length and one or more variables.
- **Clustered Column** 
- **Box & Whiskers** 
- **Pie Chart** 
- **Area** 
- **Stock** plots financial instruments, showing high, low, and closing prices.
- **Surface** plots data with three related variables.
- **Radar** 
- **Treemap** 
- **Sunburst** 
- **Waterfall** 
- **Combo** 

#### Pie vs. Bar
> :exclamation: People judge length better than area. Pie charts show area, so they suck.
>> This is a common critique of pie charts among people who care a lot about data visualization.

#### Changing the Chart Type
- Excel remembers your data range.
- You don’t need to change your axis labels, either.
- You might need to change the fonts to make sure everything is in proportion.

## Prepare the Data for Visualization
> Sometimes you need to transform the data in order to graph it effectively.
>> Creating effective graphics isn’t just about using the graphical manipulation features of Excel effectively. It’s also about making sure that your data is prepped correctly for a good visualization.

## More than Excel
- Recent versions of Excel are more powerful and versatile than ever, and Excel’s features are more than most people need to manage their data.
- But it never hurts to be aware of other visualization options, and if you find yourself spending hours and hours trying to force Excel’s charting features to create some chart that it wasn’t designed to make, then you may want to investigate other graphing programs.

> A lot of people use Excel to do things that the original designers of spreadsheets never thought to support.
>> And it’s actually one of the coolest things about how people use Excel: users dream up features, then force Excel to implement them (even in weird ways sometimes), and later Microsoft picks them up and implements them in a user-friendly way.

#### Bottom Line
Learn Excel’s features. As many as you can. Come up with creative ways to apply those features to your own problems. And if you find yourself spending a huge amount of time forcing Excel to solve your problems, consider the features of more full fledged computer or statistical programming platforms like R or Python.
