# 02 - Visual Design: *Spreadsheets as art*

## Cell Formatting
- the underlying **data** is what's taken into account when Excel **performs calculations**;
- while the **data's appearances**, i.e., **formatting**, is a **design choice** you make to make the spreadsheet more **readable and useful**.

## Design Principles
#### Simplicity
- Keep it **simple**, so you can better think about the data
- Use fonts, colors, borders, etc., with taste and restraint, i.e., only use them **to the extent** that they **help your readers organize their thinking about the data**. Anything more than that runs the risk of distracting them from the main event: the data.
#### Proximity & Alignment
- By **bunching like elements together** and **keeping all your elements in alignment with each other**, you make your document more readable and usable.

## Cell Styles & Themes
- Cell st yles keep formatting consistent **for elements that repeat**
- **With your cell styles selected**, you can use **prepackaged themes and font/color configurations** to change your look

> Some of the templates in previous versions of the software are indeed ugly, and sometimes you’ve really had to work hard to make your documents look good. But Microsoft has become progressively more sensitive to people’s need to have good design, and recent versions of Office show it.

> **Integration throughout Office** is precisely the idea. If you **make use of styles** everywhere you can, you’ll have no trouble having **consistent visual integration** across all your documents.

> **Making your own theme** would be a great idea if your business already has its own design **standards—official corporate fonts and colors**. Under these circumstances, the benefits of using styles and themes in Excel would be immense.

## Page Layout
- Switch to **page layout mode** (bottom right corner) to see how your spreadsheet will look on the printed page.
- Does it fit on one page? If not, **scale it down** on the page layout bar.
