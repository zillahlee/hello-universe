# 07 - Finding Functions: *Mine Excel's features on your own*

> **Excel has more functions than you will ever use.** Over many years and many versions, the program has accumulated specialized functions that are terribly important to the small group of people who use them. That’s not a problem for you. But what is a problem for you is **the group of functions that you don’t know but that are useful in your work**.
>> This chapter is about tips and techniques to finding quickly the formulas you need to get your work done efficiently.

## <mark>Help</mark> (Documentation)
- Search "glossary" or "functions"
  - [Excel functions (by category) :link:][1]

> *also available to use in browser!*

## Anatomy of a Function Reference
The documentation for individual functions is really interesting and useful. With the docs, you can find out:
- **what functions do**
- all the different **types of arguments they accept**
- all the **sorts of values they return**
- explanations for **why different errors might result** from the same formula

## Functions are Organized by Data Type & Discipline
> When searching for a function, pick a category first by thinking about your problem, and then inspect individual formulas in that category. That way, you’ll avoid scanning hundreds of irrelevant formulas.

## On Your Own

> In the remainder of the book, there are two more chapters (one on text data and one on Boolean data) that are about functions, and the other chapters are about other powerful features of Excel. But you’ve learned most of what you need to know to be good with formulas. What is left—for functions, at least—is mainly just figuring out which ones you need for your own work, and then the techniques you need to use to make them work well.
>> When you use formulas together in clever combinations to achieve your analytic goals. It’s one thing to understand your problem, another to understand Excel functions, and another thing entirely to be clever when it comes to matching up the problem with Excel functions.
>
>> People who are good at Excel have generally spent a lot of time working and reworking their data in a bunch of different ways with a bunch of different formulas. It’s only through that process that they discover the mind-blowing, clever solutions for the analysis of their own problems.
