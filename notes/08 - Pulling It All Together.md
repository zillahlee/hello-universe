# 08 - Pulling It All Together

> Previous chapters included piecemeal applications to demonstrate individual lessons covered. In this comprehensive chapter, we follow the storytelling with data process from start to finish using a single real-world example. We understand the context, choose an appropriate visual display, identify and eliminate clutter, draw attention to where we want our audience to focus, think like a designer, and tell a story. Together, these lessons and resulting visuals and narrative illustrate how we can move from simply showing data to telling a story with data.

## *Lesson 1:* Understand the Context

## *Lesson 3:* Eliminate Clutter



## *Lesson 4:* Draw Attention



## *Lesson 5:* Think Like a Designer



## *Lesson 6:* Tell a Story



> Through this example, we’ve seen the storytelling with data process from start to finish. We began by building a robust understanding of the context. We chose an appropriate visual display. We identified and eliminated clutter. We used preattentive attributes to draw our audience’s attention to where we want them to focus. We put on our designer hats, adding text to make our visual accessible and employing alignment to improve the aesthetics. We crafted a compelling narrative and told a story.
