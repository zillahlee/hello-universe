# 09 - Histograms: *The Shape of Numbers*

> **summarize** data fast and easily
>> measure data spread, variability, central tendency, etc.

## :bulb: Baseline Expectations
Every case is **unique**, but good data from the past gives you baseline expectations.

## Frequencies
- Histograms show frequencies of groups of numbers.
  - *frequencies*: the distribution of data points across their range of values
- **Gaps** between the bars mean gaps among the data points.
- Histograms visually show mean, median, standard deviation.
  - looking at the **shape of the curve** helps you get a sense of these numbers

## Configuring Histograms
1. Run a quick and dirty histogram on the data, using default settings
2. Examine the rough histogram
3. **Fine tune** it to something more meaningful for your analysis
4. Draw your conclusions based on the carefully reconfigured histogram(s)

## Comparison
1. Split the data into meaningful (homogeneous?) **subsets**
2. Run a histogram for each subset
3. Pay attention to the **scales** used in different histograms
4. Compare their **shapes**
